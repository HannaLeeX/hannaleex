### Hi there! 👋  
I'm Hanna, an aspiring software developer from Toronto, Canada.

I’m passionate about **problem-solving, logic, and technology**, and I'm currently applying for Shopify’s **Dev Degree** to gain hands-on experience in software development.  

As I transition into tech, I’m actively learning **Python, JavaScript, and computational thinking**. I’ve also built projects like [Dev Degree Quest](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1133378477), an interactive Scratch game designed to showcase my problem-solving skills. 

Beyond coding, I'm fascinated by AI, game development, and emerging tech trends. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, solving escape rooms, and reading.
